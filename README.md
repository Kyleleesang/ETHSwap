Deployed Addresses Notes:  ETHSwap 0x611678b9880a6F28f288C7Bc035598861bA0F480 (Sepolia)


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
Deploy to Sepolia: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js (locally) || node scripts/deploy.js --network Sepolia

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
